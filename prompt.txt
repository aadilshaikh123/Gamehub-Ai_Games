"Hello! Please generate detailed content for a PowerPoint presentation about a C++ programming project called 'AI Game Hub'. The goal is to explain the project's purpose, object-oriented design, specific features (games/simulations), and the distinct AI techniques implemented for each feature.
Target Audience: University instructors and fellow Computer Science students.
Tone: Professional, clear, technically informative, and engaging.
Output Format: Please provide the content as bullet points suitable for direct use in PowerPoint slides. Avoid generic placeholders; generate the actual explanatory text.
I. Project Overview:
Project Name: AI Game Hub
Description: A terminal-based application developed entirely in C++. It acts as a central menu hub for playing various classic games against AI opponents and running AI-driven simulations like pathfinding.
Core Goal: To apply and demonstrate C++ Object-Oriented Programming principles and implement several fundamental Artificial Intelligence algorithms in a practical, interactive context.
II. Technologies & Design:
Language: C++ (using Standard C++11/14/17 features).
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Explicitly mention the use of:
Abstraction: Via the Game abstract base class.
Inheritance: Concrete game classes derive from Game.
Polymorphism: Using virtual functions (play(), getName(), ~Game()) and base class pointers (std::unique_ptr<Game>) in the main hub loop.
Encapsulation: Each game class manages its own state and logic.
Memory Management: std::unique_ptr for automatic resource management of game objects.
Build System: CMake (CMakeLists.txt) for cross-platform compilation.
UI: Terminal/Console based. Enhanced using ANSI escape codes for text color and UTF-8 box-drawing characters for layout (managed by a utils module).
Structure:
Abstract Game base class (game.h).
Concrete derived classes for each game/solver (tictactoe.h/.cpp, connectfour.h/.cpp, nim.h/.cpp, mazesolver.h/.cpp).
Main application driver (main.cpp) containing the polymorphic game vector and menu loop.
Utility module (utils.h/.cpp) for shared functions (screen clear, pause, input validation, color constants).
III. Features & AI Techniques (Explain each AI clearly):
Tic Tac Toe:
Gameplay: Human vs. AI.
AI Technique: Minimax Algorithm.
Explain: Adversarial search for 2-player zero-sum games. Assumes optimal opponent play. Recursively explores the game tree to find the move maximizing AI's score (Win=+10, Draw=0, Loss=-10) while minimizing the human's score. Because the game tree is small, this finds the guaranteed optimal move.
Outcome: Results in a perfect AI player (cannot be beaten).
Connect Four:
Gameplay: Human vs. AI.
AI Technique: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning & Heuristic Evaluation.
Explain: Handles the larger game tree of Connect Four.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes Minimax by cutting off search branches that provably won't influence the final decision, significantly speeding up the search. Track alpha (best for MAX) and beta (best for MIN) values.
Heuristic Evaluation (evaluateBoard): Since searching to the end is often infeasible, evaluate non-terminal states reached at MAX_DEPTH. The heuristic assigns a score based on board features like potential winning lines (2-in-a-row, 3-in-a-row for AI vs. opponent) and center column control.
Outcome: A strong, strategic AI opponent, much faster than plain Minimax, but fallible due to reliance on heuristics and limited search depth.
Nim:
Gameplay: Human vs. AI. Configurable starting pile sizes.
AI Technique: Optimal Strategy using Nim-Sum.
Explain: A mathematical strategy, not typical search. Based on the bitwise XOR sum (^) of all pile sizes (Nim-sum).
Strategy: If current Nim-sum is non-zero (winning position), the AI calculates and makes the specific move to leave a Nim-sum of zero for the opponent. If the Nim-sum is already zero (losing position), the AI makes a minimal valid move (e.g., remove 1 item) as it cannot force a win.
Outcome: Mathematically perfect AI player; unbeatable if playing correctly.
Maze Solver:
Functionality: An AI simulation demonstrating pathfinding. Loads a text-based maze (maze.txt). Visualizes the search process.
AI Technique: A* Search Algorithm.
Explain: An informed search algorithm for finding the shortest path efficiently. Uses the formula fCost = gCost + hCost.
gCost: Actual cost (steps) from the start node.
hCost: Estimated cost (heuristic) from the current node to the end node (using Manhattan Distance: abs(dx) + abs(dy)).
Process: Uses a priority queue (openSet) to explore nodes with the lowest fCost first. Guided towards the goal by the heuristic.
Outcome: Guarantees finding the shortest path if one exists (given the admissible heuristic). Includes step-by-step visualization in the terminal.
