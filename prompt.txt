Okay, here is a comprehensive prompt that your friend can provide to an LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate the PowerPoint presentation content for your C++ AI Game Hub project.
This prompt includes the project's context, technical details, AI concepts, structure, and desired presentation flow based on our conversation.
Prompt for LLM:
"Generate the content for a PowerPoint presentation about a C++ project called 'AI Game Hub'. The presentation should explain the project's purpose, design, features, and the AI techniques used. The target audience is likely instructors and fellow students in a computer science course, so the tone should be clear, concise, technically accurate, and engaging.
Project Context:
The 'AI Game Hub' is a terminal-based application developed entirely in C++. It serves as a central menu allowing users to select and play different classic games against AI opponents or run AI-driven simulations. The project heavily utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and showcases various fundamental AI algorithms.
Key Technologies Used:
Language: C++ (Standard C++11 or later features)
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation.
Memory Management: std::unique_ptr (Smart Pointers).
Build System: CMake (CMakeLists.txt).
Core Libraries: Standard C++ Libraries (<iostream>, <vector>, <string>, <memory>, <queue>, <map>, <limits>, <chrono>, <thread>, etc.).
UI: Terminal/Console based, using ANSI escape codes for color and box-drawing characters for enhanced display.
System Design & Structure:
Abstract Base Class (Game): Defines a common interface with pure virtual functions play(), getName(), and a virtual destructor (~Game()).
Derived Concrete Classes: Specific games (TicTacToe, ConnectFour, Nim) and the MazeSolver simulation inherit from Game and implement the interface.
Main Hub (main.cpp):
Uses std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Game>> to hold pointers to different game objects polymorphically.
Dynamically displays a menu using game->getName().
Launches the selected game using game->play(). This is the core polymorphic interaction.
Utility Module (utils.h/.cpp): Provides shared functions for terminal screen clearing, pausing, validated integer input, and ANSI color constants.
Features & AI Techniques Implemented:
Tic Tac Toe:
Gameplay: Human vs. AI.
AI Technique: Minimax Algorithm. (Explain briefly: Assumes optimal opponent, explores game tree recursively to maximize AI score / minimize player score. Results in a perfect player for Tic Tac Toe).
UI: Enhanced terminal grid using box-drawing characters and colors.
Connect Four:
Gameplay: Human vs. AI.
AI Technique: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning & Heuristics. (Explain briefly: Alpha-Beta prunes unnecessary search branches for speed. Heuristics (evaluateBoard) estimate board 'goodness' when max depth is reached, based on line potential and center control). MAX_DEPTH limits search.
UI: Enhanced terminal grid using box-drawing characters and colors.
Nim:
Gameplay: Human vs. AI. Customizable starting piles.
AI Technique: Optimal Strategy (Nim-Sum). (Explain briefly: Uses bitwise XOR sum of piles. If Nim-sum != 0, AI makes a move to make it 0. If Nim-sum == 0, AI makes a minimal move. Mathematically guarantees perfect play).
UI: Text-based visualization of piles using colors and characters.
Maze Solver:
Functionality: Visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm. Loads a maze from maze.txt.
AI Technique: A* Search Algorithm. (Explain briefly: Informed search finds the shortest path. Uses fCost = gCost + hCost. gCost = actual cost from start, hCost = heuristic estimate (Manhattan distance) to end. Uses a priority queue to explore promising nodes).
UI: Displays the maze with colors for walls, path, start, end. Visualizes the search process step-by-step with visited nodes and highlights the final path.
Desired PowerPoint Slide Structure & Content:
Please generate bullet-point content suitable for the following slides. Feel free to suggest minor improvements or add 1-2 relevant slides if necessary (like a Technology Stack slide or Demo slide).
Title Slide: (Standard Title, Name, Course, Date)
Introduction / Overview: (Briefly what the project is, what it does)
Problem Statement: (What challenge/objective does the project address?)
Motivation: (Why was this project chosen/built?)
Solution: The AI Game Hub: (Describe the resulting application and its key parts)
Technology Stack: (List the languages, paradigms, tools used)
System Design: (Explain the OOP structure: Game base class, inheritance, polymorphism in main.cpp, utils)
AI Techniques Implemented: (Dedicate space to explain each AI used in its respective game/solver, as detailed above)
Results: (What was the outcome? Was it successful? Key achievements)
Demonstration: (Placeholder for mentioning a live demo plan)
Challenges & Learnings: (Optional but good: What was hard? What was learned?)
Future Work: (Optional: How could it be extended?)
Conclusion: (Summarize the project and its significance)
Q & A: (Standard Questions slide)
Instructions for Content Generation:
Keep the language clear, concise, and suitable for a technical presentation.
Use bullet points for easy readability on slides.
Focus on explaining the concepts (OOP, AI algorithms) clearly using the project components as examples.
Ensure the content directly reflects the project details provided above.
Do not include generic placeholder text like "[Insert explanation here]". Generate the actual explanatory text.
Thank you!"
This prompt provides the LLM with:
The project's name and purpose.
The specific technologies and C++ features used.
The OOP design philosophy and structure.
A detailed breakdown of each game/simulation module.
Specific information on the AI algorithm used in each module and a brief explanation.
The desired presentation structure and slide titles.
Instructions on the desired tone and format of the output.
This should give the LLM enough information to generate a relevant and helpful PowerPoint presentation outline and content for your friend.
